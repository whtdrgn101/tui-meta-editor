# TUI-META-EDITOR
This repo is for a utility created to assist in the ripping and meta-data editing of TV series I purchase.  This allows me to get consistent file naming and meta-data conventions when converting my DVD's and Blu-Ray discs into files for my media server.  

## Installation / Usage
This uses the standard python virtual environment and some libraries/utilities for working with the metadata in the media files.  Follow these steps to setup:

1. python -m venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate or venv\Scripts\activate.bat on windows
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. install a MKV utilitity (sort out later)
5. python app.py
